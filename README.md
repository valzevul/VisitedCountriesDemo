# VisitedCountriesDemo
Demo for CocoaHeads Moscow session in June, 2015.

Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/valzevul/ui-xcode-cocoaheads-moscow

## What is done?
* Simple app for tracking countries you've visited.
* Two templates for tests.

## Where to go from here?
* Try to write a test for removing items by swipe to left (that's a bit tricky despite the WWDC lectures example).
* Try to fix the ambiguity with name of cells (hint: use identifiers).
